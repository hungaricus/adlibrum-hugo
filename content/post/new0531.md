# Hands-on experience with Hugo as a static site generator

A while ago – in April 2015 – we launched [bugtrackers.io](http://bugtrackers.io) as a **small side project**. Since then, the site has grown from a three-pager to a website with dozens of ~~interviews~~.

We also ended up using GoHugo as our main website framework for bugtrackers.io. In this post I’m going to share some of our first experiences with GoHugo as well as our path to ending up where we are right now.
