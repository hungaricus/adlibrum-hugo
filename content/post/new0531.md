# Hands-on experience with Hugo as a static site generator

A while ago – in April 2015 – we launched [bugtrackers.io](http://bugtrackers.io) as a **small side project**. Since then, the site has grown from a three-pager to a website with dozens of ~~interviews~~.

The increasing number of pages & therefore line of code made us look for ways to improve our internal workflow.

We also ended up using GoHugo as our main website framework for bugtrackers.io. In this post I’m going to share some of our first experiences with GoHugo as well as our path to ending up where we are right now.
If you like this article, give it some sharing ❤️
